# Hotel-Rerservation-System

Simple Online Hotel Reservation System is developed using PHP, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Talking about the project, it contains a user and admin side from where a user can make an online reservation easily. From the admin panel, he/she can maintain room records, manage reservations and more. The Admin plays an important role in the management of the system. In this project, the user has to perform all the main functions from the Admin side.
